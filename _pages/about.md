I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"}, advised by [Prof. Sewoong Oh](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests lie broadly in the fields of machine learning and optimization, particularly in characterizing fundamental quantities, phenomena, and general laws that emerge at scale. During the summer of 2023, I interned as a quantitative analyst in the Equities group at [The D. E. Shaw Group](https://www.deshaw.com/){:target="_blank"}. I will be joining [The D. E. Shaw Group](https://www.deshaw.com/){:target="_blank"} (NYC) as a full-time quantitative analyst in fall 2024.

Prior to joining graduate school, I spent two enriching years as a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/research-fellow-program/?#){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"}, where I worked with [Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli](https://praneethnetrapalli.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/){:target="_blank"} on providing provable guarantees for non-convex optimization algorithms used in machine learning. Before the fellowship, I attended [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php){:target="_blank"} in 2017. My experiences prior to graduate school were instrumental in shaping my subsequent research interests and pursuits.

In my spare time, I like learning Mathematical Analysis, Geometry, Theoretical Physics, Modern Finance, Economics and Philosophy.
