I'm a Ph.D. candidate at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"}, advised by [Prof. Sewoong Oh](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/){:target="_blank"}. I enjoy exploring and characterizing phenomena, fundamental quantities, and general laws that emerge at scale in science. Last summer, I interned as a quantitative analyst in the systematic equities group at [The D. E. Shaw Group](https://www.deshaw.com/){:target="_blank"}. Following an internship last summer, I will join [The D. E. Shaw Group](https://www.deshaw.com/){:target="_blank"} in New York City as a full-time quantitative analyst starting this fall.

Before starting my graduate school, I spent two rewarding years as a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/research-fellow-program/?#){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"}. There, under the mentorship of [Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli](https://praneethnetrapalli.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/){:target="_blank"}, I delved into some research problems related to non-convex optimization in machine learning. Before this fellowship, I earned my B. Tech. in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php){:target="_blank"} from [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2017. These experiences played a crucial role in shaping my subsequent research interests and career pursuits.

In my spare time, I enjoy learning general Mathematics, Theoretical Physics, Modern Finance and Economics.
