<!-- This is what I once heard from an artist in of their interviews. Upon being asked on what they think 'art' is about, they answer - "Most people feel that painting a picture is an art form, and singing a song is an art. The most beautiful thing about art, I think, is that it is a medium through which two unrelated beings can convey empathy, thoughts, and emotions. This exchange of emotions can occur by looking at a painting, watching a play or a movie, listening to an instrument, reading a poem, or simply listening to someone.". Well, I think Mathematics seemingly qualifies this characterization. -->
