I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} advised by [Prof. Sewoong Oh](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/){:target="_blank"}.

Currently, I am trying to understand the scaling limit of gradient flows of functions over large dense unlabeled weighted graphs (examples include single and multilayer neural networks). Such graphs are known to have analytical limits known as [Graphons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphon){:target="_blank"}. Our recent [work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09459){:target="_blank"} studies the existence of gradient flows on the space of graphons, and the conditions under which a standard gradient descent process over finite graphs converges to a well-defined gradient flow on the space of graphons, as the size of the graphs increase. Stochastic analogs of the problem are also of interest where we provide mean-field type limits of interacting diffusions on random matrices.

Prior to joining graduate school, I spent two amazingly wonderful years as a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/research-fellow-program/?#){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli](https://praneethnetrapalli.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/){:target="_blank"} on provable non-convex optimization algorithms for Machine Learning and understanding several phenomena in deep learning. Prior to the fellowship, I attended [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php){:target="_blank"} in 2017.

In my spare time, I like learning Mathematical Analysis, Geometry, theoretical Physics, modern Finance and Economics. Personally and more broadly, I consider myself as a student of Mathematics, seeking its artistic elegance in various scientific subjects. I believe that as intelligent human beings, our powers of curiosity, mathematical reason and logic are not limited by problems and applications in the physical world, but transcend them opening illimitable possibilities.
