I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} advised by [Prof. Sewoong Oh](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/){:target="_blank"}.

Currently, I am working on understanding the scaling limit of gradient flows over functions on large graphs that are invariant under vertex relabelings. The analytical limits of such graphs are knows as graphons. An examaple of such large graphs are neural networks with multiple hidden layers where instead of a single graph we have a sequence of bipartite graphs, and successive graphs share vertices. Our most recent [work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09459){:target="_blank"} studies the existence of gradient flows on graphons, and the conditions under which coordinate-wise Euclidean gradient descent converges to such limiting curves.
Adjacently, I am interested in learning optimal transport theory, limiting graph theory, analysis, and metric geometry.

Prior to joining graduate school, I spent two amazingly wonderful years as a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/research-fellow-program/?#){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli](https://praneethnetrapalli.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/){:target="_blank"} on provable non-convex optimization algorithms for Machine Learning and understanding several phenomena in deep learning. Prior to the fellowship, I attended [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php){:target="_blank"} in 2017.

In my spare time, I like learning Mathematical Analysis, Geometry and theoretical Physics. Personally and more broadly, I primarily consider myself as a student of Mathematics, seeking its artistic elegance in various scientific subjects.
