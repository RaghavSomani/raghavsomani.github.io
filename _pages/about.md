I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} advised by [Prof. Sewoong Oh](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/){:target="_blank"}.

Currently, I am trying to understand the limiting continuous training dynamics as a good proxy for the discrete training dynamics of arbitrary (including infinite dimensional) neural networks using the lens of optimal transport, limiting graph theory and metric geometry. Related topics in vicinity include gradient flows/descent on metric spaces, and optimization under over-parameterization.

Previously, I spent two amazingly wonderful years as a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/research-fellow-program/?#){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli](https://praneethnetrapalli.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/){:target="_blank"} on provable non-convex optimization algorithms for Machine Learning and understanding several phenomena in deep learning. Prior to the fellowship, I attended [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php){:target="_blank"} in 2017.

In my spare time, I like learning Mathematical Analysis, Geometry and theoretical Physics. Personally and more broadly, I primarily consider myself as a student of Mathematics, and thrive to seek its artistic elegence in various scientific subjects.
