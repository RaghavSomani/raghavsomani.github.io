Upon being asked about what 'art' is, an artist replied - "Most people feel that painting a picture is an art form, and singing a song is an art. The most beautiful thing about art, I think, is that it is a medium through which two unrelated beings can convey empathy, thoughts, and emotions. This exchange of emotions can occur by looking at a painting, watching a play or a movie, listening to an instrument, reading a poem, or simply listening to someone." Well, I feel that mathematics seemingly qualifies this characterization. A very similar statement recently made by Prof. June Huh, the winner of the Fields medal in 2022, one of the highest honors awarded for outstanding mathematical achievements - "... I dreamed of becoming a poet, to express the inexpressible. I eventually learned that mathematics is a way of doing that."
 
It is expected for a reader to wonder, what does art have to do with Mathematics? We even have Bachelor and Master degree courses in Arts with concentration in Mathematics if this further raises any curiosity. How are finding solutions of a differential equation, finding the probability of a dart hitting the bull's eye, or finding the rational solutions of a polynomial equation, art forms? Are we seeking for some form of simplistic beautiful structure in their solutions? Or are we admiring the elegance of how one can approach their solutions? Or is there a symphony across all these different questions? It is also said that Mathematics is the queen of all sciences, and that Mathematics is the language of science. Is Mathematics now a form of science? Many readers might agree to this more easily in their hindsight that they would agree on the prior claim that Mathematics is an art. Many might have heard of Galileo's famous quote - "The book of nature is written in the language of mathematics."
 
As a young middle school student, I was poor in subjects like literature and history. I never liked the idea of learning things that were subjective, had a multitude of perspectives of reason, and had very little to do with reality as I used to see it. On the contrary, my fond for physical sciences and mathematics was driven by their objective nature and how there seemed to be clearer boundaries between the correct and the incorrect. I used to enjoy how concepts in mathematics were immediately used in physical science that helped understand the truths of the nature of the physical universe. Quantification of physical phenomena and laws seemed to provide the power of predictability with precision. Of course, we ignored air friction in most of the physics problems, but you get the core principles right, that were always right and will be right. The Newtonian lens of thought created a fine mark on my scientific thinking ability later during my high school. With eventually diving deeper into modern concepts in modern theoretical physics, I was eager to pursue a career in the same. My elder cousin recommended that I first study and work on my mathematical abilities, and later specialize in any scientific subject of choice. I feel fortunate to have taken this route which provided me enough opportunities and instances where I enjoyed glimpses of mathematical beauty under a formal rigor-full setup. The journey since then has been overly exciting and the pleasure of seeking artistic elegance in various scientific disciplines has kept me grounded and going. Now when I look back, I realize that subjective reasoning holds a fundamental role in grooming scientific ideas and thoughts and can be shaped using mathematical ideas.
 
A pure mathematician seeks to study the subject for its own sake, independent of any practical applicability. The tree of knowledge is allowed to grow, through reason, in any direction, through any branch, driven by curiosity. Does this mean that the ultimate tree of knowledge is therefore fractal? The hunt in hindsight includes discovering dots and connecting as many of them as possible, ultimately revealing beautiful truths which hold permanent value. These dots usually stem out the hope of discovering various facets of mathematical beauty in the form of completeness, soundness and broader coherence. Breakthroughs in mathematics usually are not over complex and convoluted problems. They are often when mathematicians discover fundamental bridges that are able to connect two seemingly different ideas, thereby promoting the sense of unification. Being able to see connections between different ideas is genuinely pleasing to a mathematician. For example, certain areas in mathematics like analysis and algebra used to be considered distinct areas, but algebraic analysis is now an essential part of modern mathematics. Joseph Fourier, a mathematician and physicist during the early industrial revolution, remarks - "Mathematics compares the most diverse phenomena and discovers the secret analogies that unite them". G. H. Hardy, an English mathematician, and a fellow of the Royal Society, provides a clearer description of the same - "We may say, roughly, that a mathematical idea is 'significant' if it can be connected, in a natural and illuminating way, with a large complex of other mathematical ideas". Richard Feynman, a particle physicist and Nobel prize winner says in one of his lectures - "You have to have some understanding of the connection of the words with the real world, and this is a problem which is not a problem of mathematics at all. Mathematicians also like to make their reasoning as general as possible.". This nature of mathematics is probably the most startling property I can ask from any subject as a guide to the idea of perfection.
 
Let me give an example of what I mean. At first sight, the subject of geometry and algebra, as we study in secondary school, appears to be unrelated areas in mathematics. Greek philosophers and mathematicians used geometry to decode the celestial unknowns. We soon realize in high school that geometrical objects can have algebraic characterizations in the form of equations of curves. We can now easily convert most algebraic equations to geometrical objects, concepts and ideas, and most of geometry to algebraic relations with the help of a coordinate system. But a coordinate system can allow more than the three spatial coordinates, and therefore if we use different coordinates for different variables associated to various properties and quantities, we might simultaneously express all the variables all together. It then becomes natural to ask how one quantity affects the other quantity, or more precisely, how does a change in one attribute change the others. We soon realize that Newtonian calculus gives us sufficient language to frame such questions and reason about them using the principles of mathematical analysis. Geometry, algebra and calculus, which initially seem to be different areas of mathematics, now can coherently encode classical physics. Extending this chain, if we allow complex number analysis, probability theory, differential geometry, functional analysis, and higher abstractions of algebra and geometry, we can formalize most laws of modern physics. In the words of Nikola Tesla, "What one man calls God, another calls laws of physics".
 
The scientific revolution has propelled substantial progress in pure mathematics where many mathematical concepts and connections were discovered out of necessity. The Industrial revolution served as a test bed for this formalism that led to developments in several areas in applied mathematics creating newer questions and ventures in the broader field. We have had various instances in the scientific history where new mathematical reasonings have led to several scientific advancements, and this has now been a go to recipe of reason in most modern natural sciences. We have discovered more mathematics in the last century than all mathematics combined before it.
 
But what really is mathematics? I like the way Paul Halmos, a Hungarian-American mathematician describes it - "For the professional pure mathematician, mathematics is the logical dovetailing of a carefully selected sparse set of assumptions with their surprising conclusions via a conceptually elegant proof. Simplicity, intricacy, and above all, logical analysis are the hallmark of mathematics. The mathematician is interested in extreme cases - in this respect he is like the industrial experimenter who breaks lightbulbs, tears shirts, and bounces cars on ruts. How widely does a reasoning apply, he wants to know, and what happens when it doesn't? What happens when you weaken one of the assumptions, or under what conditions can you strengthen one of the conclusions? It is the perpetual asking of such questions that makes for broader understanding, better technique, and greater elasticity for future problems". Adding to what rigorous mathematical reasoning looks like, he writes - "Mathematics - this may surprise you or shock you some - is deductive in its creation. The mathematician at work makes vague guesses, visualizes broad generalizations, and jumps to unwarranted conclusions. He arranges and rearranges his ideas, and he becomes convinced of their truth long before he can write down a logical proof". The ability to use rigorous proof-based logic to identify different cases of a problem, understanding what it takes for a statement to be true, logical equivalences versus false analogies, is a muscle I believe is worthwhile to develop. Unsystematic thinking and verbosity without substance have no place in mathematics. The ability of critical thinking can go a long way in maintaining intelligent and healthy human societies.
 
Mathematics has been more than just a subject of study to me. It has allowed me to stay grounded and enjoy spiritual peace by thriving for raw knowledge. To Paul Erdős, one of the most prolific mathematicians of the last century, mathematics is the key to the transcendental truth underlying all of reality. Solving a problem is a triumph over the unknown. Content is never a state of being. Dig deep enough into anything it seems and you find mathematics. This observation has led philosophers into a conclusion that everything including ourselves, is a part of a mathematical structure. We live in a world full of colors, emotions, sensations, and experiences, which we can't for now turn into numbers or equations. It is true that all matter is made up of fundamental particles such as electrons and quarks, the properties of which appear to be purely mathematical. As soon as we try to chase down an individual particle like an electron, it seems to lose its substance and wash out into a wave of probabilities. What we take to be physical, hard edged and tangible, melts into something abstract and without substance. Spacetime too upon close examination, reduces to a mere mathematical structure. In the words of string theorist and mathematician Brian Greene, "Physicists have come to realize that mathematics, when used with sufficient care, is a proven pathway to truth". The Higgs Boson popped out of the mathematics done 48 years before it was finally detected by an experiment at the large hadron collider. Already it is clear that the mathematics used in science is far more than just a handy notational system. It's a highly effective way of modeling the universe. The question is whether it runs deeper than that. Max Tegmark, a Swedish-American physicist at MIT has a bold stance to this question, in which he denies the existence of anything other than mathematics objects. Somewhat disturbingly this would even include ourselves, and contents of our minds and awareness. Though we are yet to fully understand the ultimate role that mathematics plays in the reality around up and within us. Matter and energy dance to the tune of mathematics. The mind perceives the existence of matter and explains its behavior through mathematics. Somehow it seems that mind, matter and mathematics rely on the presence of each other as elements in a self-sustaining and self-actualizing cosmic triangle. In an interview with Paul Halmos from 1999, he remarks - "How do I think about mathematical objects? Do they have an existence independent of you and me? And I know the answer, I know the answer, for absolutely sure, yes, they do. You didn't invent them; I didn't invent them. You and I have nothing to do with mathematical questions, with mathematical concepts, with mathematical statements. If I were a religious man, I'd say God invented them. He gives us the questions, and if he is good and we are good, he gives us the answers."
