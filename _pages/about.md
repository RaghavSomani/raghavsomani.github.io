I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} advised by [Prof. Sewoong Oh](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/){:target="_blank"}.

Currently, I am trying to analytically understand the limiting continuous as well as discrete training dynamics of arbitrary neural networks using the lens of optimal transport, limiting graph theory and algebra. Related topics in vicinity include gradient flow/descent on metric spaces, and optimization under over-parameterization. I also like learning mathematical Analysis, Geometry and theoretical Physics.

Previously, I spent two amazingly wonderful years as a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/research-fellow-program/?#){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli](https://praneethnetrapalli.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/){:target="_blank"} on provable non-convex optimization algorithms for Machine Learning and understanding several phenomena in deep learning. Prior to the fellowship, I attended [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php){:target="_blank"} in 2017.
