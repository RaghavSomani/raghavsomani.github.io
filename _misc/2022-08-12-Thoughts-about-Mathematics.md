<!-- Upon being asked about what 'art' is, an artist replied - "Most people feel that painting a picture is an art form, and singing a song is an art. The most beautiful thing about art, I think, is that it is a medium through which two unrelated beings can convey empathy, thoughts, and emotions. This exchange of emotions can occur by looking at a painting, watching a play or a movie, listening to an instrument, reading a poem, or simply listening to someone." Well, Mathematics seemingly qualifies this characterization. A very similar statement recently - "... I dreamed of becoming a poet, to express the inexpressible. I eventually learned that mathematics is a way of doing that." - Prof. June Huh, winner of the Fields medal in 2022, one of the highest honors awarded for outstanding mathematical achievements.

You might wonder, what does art have to do with Mathematics? We even have Bachelor and Master degree courses in Arts with concentration in Mathematics if this further raises any curiosity. How are finding solutions of a differential equation, finding the probability of a dart hitting the bull's eye, or finding the rational solutions of a polynomial equation, art forms? Are we seeking for some form of simplistic beauty in their solutions? Or are we admiring the elegance of how one can approach their solutions? It is also said that Mathematics is the queen of all sciences, and that Mathematics is the language of science. Is Mathematics now a form of science? Many readers might agree to this more easily that they would agree on the prior claim that Mathematics is an art. Many of the readers might have heard of Galileo's famous quote - "Mathematics is the langauge in which God has written the universe."

As a young middle school student, I was poor in subjects like literature and history. I never liked the idea of learning things that were subjective, had multitude of perspectives of reason, and had very less to do with the present reality as I used to see it. On the contrary, my fond for physical science and mathematics was driven by their objective nature and how there seemed to be clearer boundaries between the correct and the incorrect. I used to enjoy how concepts in mathematics were immediately used in physical science that helped understand the truths of the nature of the physical universe. Quantification of physical phenomena and laws seemed to provide the power of predictability with precision. Ofcourse we ignored air friction in most of the physics problems, but you get the core principles right under simplified setups. The Newtonian lens of thought created a fine mark in my scientific thinking ability later during my high school. With eventually diving deeper into modern concepts in Physics, I was eager to pursue a career in the same. My elder cousin recommended me to first study and work on my mathematical abilities, and later specialize in any scientific subject of choice. I feel fortunate to have taken this route which provided me enough opportunities and instances where I enjoyed glimpses of mathematical beauty under a formal rigorful setup. Journey since then has been very exciting and the joy of seeking an artistic elegance in various scienfific disciplies has keept me grounded and going. Now when I look back, I realize that subjective reasoning holds a fundamental role in grooming scientific ideas and thoughts.

A pure mathematician seeks to study the subject for its own sake, independent of any practical applicability. The knowledge tree is allowed to grow in any direction through any branch. The goals in the hindsight stay the same, which includes discovering dots and connecting as many of them as possible. These dots usually stem out from curiosity and the hope of discovering various facets of mathematical beauty in the form of coherence, completeness and soundness. Breakthroughs in mathematics usually are not over complex and convoluted problems. They are often when mathematicians discover fundamental bridges that are able to connect two seemingly different concepts or ideas in mathematics, thereby promoting the sense of unification.

From the first sight, the subject of geometry and algebra, as we study in secondary school, appear to be unrelated areas of mathematics. But we soon realize in high school that geometrical objects can have algebraic characterizations in the form of equations of curves, opening vast possibilities. We can now easily convert most algebraic equations to geometrical objects and most geometrical shapes to algebraic equation with the help of a coordinate system. Coordinate systems now can allow the use higher dimensions for different variables associated to various properties and quantities that we might like to associate. Once we have various variables, it becomes natural to ask how one affets the other, or more precisely, how does a change in one variable change the rest. We soon realize that Newtonian calculus gives us a sufficient language to frame such questions and reason about them. Geometry, algebra and calculus which initially seem to be different arenas, now can coherently encode clasical physics. Extending this chain, if we allow complex analysis, probability theory, differential geometry and higher abstractions of algebra, we can formalize most of the modern physics.

The scientific revolution has propelled substantial progress in pure mathematics where most mathematical concepts and connections where discovered out of neccessity. Industrial revolution served as a test bed for this formalism that led to developments in several areas in applied mathematics creating newer questions and ventures in the broad field of Mathematics. We have had various instances in the scientific history that mathematical discoveries and predictions have led to several scientific advancements, and this has now been a go to recipie of reason in most modern engineering sciences.
