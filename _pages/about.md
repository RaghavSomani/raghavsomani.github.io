I am a quantitative researcher at [D. E. Shaw & Co.](https://www.deshaw.com/){:target="_blank"} in New York City, where I work in quantitative finance as a part of the D. E. Shaw Investment Management (DESIM) group.

Before working in finance, I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sewoong Oh](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sewoong/){:target="_blank"}. My research focused on exploring and characterizing phenomena, fundamental quantities, and general laws that emerge at scale in science.

Before starting my graduate school, I spent two years as a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/research-fellow-program/?#){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"}, working with [Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli](https://praneethnetrapalli.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/){:target="_blank"}. Before this fellowship, I earned my B. Tech. in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php){:target="_blank"} from [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2017. These experiences played a crucial role in shaping my subsequent research interests and career pursuits.

In my spare time, I enjoy learning general mathematics, modern finance and economics.
