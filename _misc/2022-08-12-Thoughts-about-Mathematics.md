<!-- Upon being asked about what 'art' is, an artist replied - "Most people feel that painting a picture is an art form, and singing a song is an art. The most beautiful thing about art, I think, is that it is a medium through which two unrelated beings can convey empathy, thoughts, and emotions. This exchange of emotions can occur by looking at a painting, watching a play or a movie, listening to an instrument, reading a poem, or simply listening to someone." Well, I feel that mathematics seemingly qualifies this characterization. A very similar statement recently made by Prof. June Huh, the winner of the Fields medal in 2022, one of the highest honors awarded for outstanding mathematical achievements - "... I dreamed of becoming a poet, to express the inexpressible. I eventually learned that mathematics is a way of doing that."

It is expected for a reader to wonder, what does art have to do with Mathematics? We even have Bachelor and Master degree courses in Arts with concentration in Mathematics if this further raises any curiosity. How are finding solutions of a differential equation, finding the probability of a dart hitting the bull's eye, or finding the rational solutions of a polynomial equation, art forms? Are we seeking for some form of simplistic beauty in their solutions? Or are we admiring the elegance of how one can approach their solutions? Or is there a symphony across all these different questions? It is also said that Mathematics is the queen of all sciences, and that Mathematics is the language of science. Is Mathematics now a form of science? Many readers might agree to this more easily that they would agree on the prior claim that Mathematics is an art. Many might have heard of Galileo's famous quote - "The book of nature is written in the language of mathematics."

As a young middle school student, I was poor in subjects like literature and history. I never liked the idea of learning things that were subjective, had multitude of perspectives of reason, and had very less to do with the reality as I used to see it. On the contrary, my fond for physical sciences and mathematics was driven by their objective nature and how there seemed to be clearer boundaries between the correct and the incorrect. I used to enjoy how concepts in mathematics were immediately used in physical science that helped understand the truths of the nature of the physical universe. As Nikola Tesla said - "What one man calls God, another calls laws of phsyics." Quantification of physical phenomena and laws seemed to provide the power of predictability with precision. Ofcourse we ignored air friction in most of the physics problems, but you get the core principles right, that were always right and will be right. The Newtonian lens of thought created a fine mark in my scientific thinking ability later during my high school. With eventually diving deeper into modern concepts in Physics, I was eager to pursue a career in the same. My elder cousin recommended me to first study and work on my mathematical abilities, and later specialize in any scientific subject of choice. I feel fortunate to have taken this route which provided me enough opportunities and instances where I enjoyed glimpses of mathematical beauty under a formal rigorful setup. Journey since then has been very exciting and the pleasure of seeking artistic elegance in various scienfific disciplies has keept me grounded and going. Now when I look back, I realize that subjective reasoning holds a fundamental role in grooming scientific ideas and thoughts, and can be shaped using mathematical ideas.

A pure mathematician seeks to study the subject for its own sake, independent of any practical applicability. The tree of knowledge is allowed to grow in any direction through any branch. This however, does not mean that the ultimate tree of knowledge is therefore fractal. The hunt in the hindsight stay the same, which includes discovering dots and connecting as many of them as possible, ultimately revealing beautiful truths which hold permanent value. These dots usually stem out from curiosity and the hope of discovering various facets of mathematical beauty in the form of  completeness, soundness and broader coherence. Breakthroughs in mathematics usually are not over complex and convoluted problems. They are often when mathematicians discover fundamental bridges that are able to connect two seemingly different ideas, thereby promoting the sense of unification. This feeling of being able to see connections between different ideas is genuinely pleasing to a mathematician. As Joseph Fourier, a mathematician and physist during the early industrial revolution, said - "Mathematics compares the most diverse phenomena and discovers the secret analogies that unite them." This nature of mathematics is probably the most startling properties I can ask from any subject. G. H. Hardy provide a clearer description of the same - "We may say, roughly, that a mathematical idea is 'significant' if it can be connected, in a natural and illuminating way, with a large complex of other mathematical ideas."

From the first sight, the subject of geometry and algebra, as we study in secondary school, appear to be unrelated areas of mathematics. Greek mathematicians used geometry to decode the celestial knowledge. We soon realize in high school that geometrical objects can have algebraic characterizations in the form of equations of curves, opening vast possibilities. We can now easily convert most algebraic equations to geometrical objects and most geometrical shapes to algebraic equation with the help of a coordinate system. Coordinate systems now can allow the use higher dimensions for different variables associated to various properties and quantities that we might like to associate. Once we have various variables, it becomes natural to ask how one affets the other, or more precisely, how does a change in one variable change the rest. We soon realize that Newtonian calculus gives us a sufficient language to frame such questions and reason about them using first principles. Geometry, algebra and calculus which initially seem to be different arenas, now can coherently encode clasical physics. Extending this chain, if we allow complex analysis, probability theory, differential geometry and higher abstractions of algebra, we can formalize most of modern physics. In the words of Nikola Tesla, "What one man calls God, another calls laws of phsyics". The scientific revolution has propelled substantial progress in pure mathematics where most mathematical concepts and connections where discovered out of neccessity. Industrial revolution served as a test bed for this formalism that led to developments in several areas in applied mathematics creating newer questions and ventures in the broader field. We have had various instances in the scientific history that mathematical discoveries and predictions have led to several scientific advancements, and this has now been a go to recipie of reason in most modern engineering sciences.




# You have to have some understanding of the connection of the words with the real world, and this is a problem which is not a problem of mathematics at all. Mathematicians also like to make their reasoning as general as possible. - Feynman on what differs physics from mathematics.

# What one man calls God, another calls laws of phsyics- Nicola Tesla

# A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. - G. H. Hardy
# Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics. - G. H. Hardy
